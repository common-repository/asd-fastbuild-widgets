A set of widgets and a Site Data control panel for defining and displaying elements common to almost all sites (name, logo, tagline) and inserting this data into Structured Data.

=== Description ===
ASD FastBuild Widgets speed and simplify building and customizing the standard things that most sites require (Logo, Title, Tagline, Phone). A "Site Data" dashboard control panel defines fields for Schema.org Organization data items that it will inserted into the page as JSON-LD formatted Structured Data. Also included are two widgets based on Bootstrap 3 Nav, a Navbar Widget and a Pills Nav Widget.

ASD FastBuild Widgets work best with a theme which is rich in Widgetized areas, particularly in the header and footer, such as [White Summer](https://artisansitedesigns.com/themes/white-summer/)

= Rich Content =
ASD FastBuild Widgets generate Rich Content through the insertion of JSON-LD Structured Data into the HTML Footer. This data is defined in the Site Data control panel, and the output Structured Data is  based on Schema.org definitions.

Use Google's Structured Data Testing Tool to see how the search engine sees your structured data.
